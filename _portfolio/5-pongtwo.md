## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a> <br>
Pong was created for a multi-part talk I gave for Inland Empire Software Development on Unity game development. Part one started with a very basic pong game. Part two expanded on what was learned and introduced the Model View Controller design pattern. It also added modular design, a start and pause menu, ball direction randomization, and randomized sounds.
