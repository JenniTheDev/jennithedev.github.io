## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a> <br>
Pong was the first commercial available video game, and it played a major role in starting the gaming industry. Why not learn Unity while making a Pong game? We will learn to import and use prefabs, create game objects, keep our game organized, assign Physics to our game objects, and write a simple controller script for our ball and paddles. At the end of these talks, we will have a working Pong game.
