# TLDR: 
I'm a really great programmer and fun to work with. Take a look at [my projects](https://jennithe.dev/projects/), [my blog](https://jennithe.dev/blog/) and [my resume](https://jennithe.dev/resume/).

# A little about me
Once upon a time, I was an apartment manager. Every time I got a new job I had to move. I eventually got tired of moving and decided to spend time with my kids. After driving them enough miles to go to the moon and back, I decided to go back to school. I figured I would just get my A.A to be a good example to them. I didn't just stop at one A.A, I got an A.S and then my B.S in Computer Science as well. I made my first game in my Intro To Computer Programming class and have been enjoying programming ever since. 

While getting my degree at California State University, Fullerton, I got to work with a lot of other students. During group projects, I found myself in a position of leadership every time, and discovered that I had a real aptitude for it. I also joined the Video Game Development Club and the Women in Computer Science and Engineering. Showcasing the game my team made, [Espere's Journey](https://jennithe.dev/portfolio/2-esperesjourney/), was one of the highlights of my time at CSUF. Outside of school, I work on my coding skills by collaborating with other developers to create projects and review our code. 

I'm currently working as an Associate Software Engineer at Blizzard. I enjoy solving problems and making great experiences for people. As a 13+ year WoW player, it's been an amazing journey to get to work on one of my favorite games.
