I was reflecting back on some of my previous World of Warcraft experiences (and friends) and how they made me a better software developer. Raiding takes teamwork, dedication, and patience, just like any job does. Except you don't get paid.  

- I learned how to take criticism
No one likes to be told they are doing something wrong. Me included. I would always look at the logs of the characters performing better then me, find them, and ask them how I could improve. I would work together with other guild members to look for ways to improve. I do the same as a Software Developer. Other people will tell you to make changes and improvements to your code (*cough* braces go on a new line people *cough*). I've learned to not take it personally, think carefully about what is being told to me, and evaluate if I want to make that change.

- I learned to admit my mistakes and learn from them
After a wipe (when we all die and the boss doesn't), generally the raid leader will ask who messed up. Raid members will explain up what they did wrong. It's really uncomfortable to admit to 25+ other people that you didn't push a button at the right time. But, the more you do it the less uncomfortable it gets. I've carried that over to all of my projects. If I made a mistake, it's easier to just go tell someone, fix it, and learn not to do it again. It happens to all of us.



- I learned determination
When people would ask me how our raid got our boss kills, I always told them that it was because we didn't give up. I think I remember it taking somewhere around 86 different tries to kill the boss. That's 85 times of not doing it right in some way. Each time, we would assess our mistakes and try to do better. The same goes for Software Development. If it didn't do what I wanted the first time, I keep on assessing what the problem is and make changes to fix it.

- I learned to celebrate my wins
Finishing a project with a team feels as good as killing a raid boss does. Finishing [Microverse](https://jennithe.dev/portfolio/1-microverse/) and reaching the end of our semester progress on [Espere's Jounrey](https://jennithe.dev/portfolio/2-esperesjourney/) was a very proud moment. It made me as proud as when we killed a raid boss and could brag to our friends that we finally did it. Making games is way cooler when you can show your friends the game you made, especially when they are happy to play it.
