When I transferred to CSUF, I was originally a Geology major. If you think about it, geology and computer science have a lot of things in common. Both of them require you to think very logically. 

For my field geology class, we had to survey a geological area and write a report about what the rocks were telling us. The hardest part of the assignment was to condense more then a billion years of geologic history into a two page report. We were told that after two pages, our professor would stop reading and that was it.

It was a challenge to keep everything I learned about Rainbow Basin contained in two pages, and also make it readable. We also had no constraints on additional pages, so I added in some photos and maps that I had taken at Rainbow Basin. On this trip, I really appreciated how easy technology made some things, like measuring strike and dips on rocks that were across the basin from me.
